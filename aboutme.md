### My story

I started to programming since 11 years old in Visual Basic 6, having an happing computer destroyer childhood. Happy experience in programming in different language (VB.NET, C++, PHP, Javascript) in childhood, at 16 years old I started to disassembly x86 executables and reading books about assembly and pwning some games (my hacker side).

During my bachelor degree I improved my hacking and programming skills, and started to love not so classical language such as Python 🐍

I get 1st place in [CyberChallenge](https://cyberchallenge.it/) national context in individual competition within university context and 12th/31 place in team competition national context in 2011.
